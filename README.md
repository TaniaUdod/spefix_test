# User Management App

This project is a simple web application built with **Next.js** and **React.js** that allows users to view a list of users and add new ones. The app implements basic server-side rendering (SSR) for initial data loading and an API for retrieving and adding users.


## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** framework used for server-side rendering and API routes. 
- **React.js** library for building the user interface. 
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - programming languages used for development. 
- **API routes in Next.js** - for handling data fetching and user addition (`pages/api`).
